# Space invaders

## About
This was made as an application submission for a developer position I was interested in. They asked us to make a space invaders type game with any additional tweaks that we want (or just implement the original in Unity). I decided to stay true to the roots and make (as much as I could) an exact replica of the game. However, by the time I was finished, there was still plenty of time and I wasn't satisfied - so I added stuff like rapid fire and missile upgrades.  
  
Here is some footage of the finished game (there is sound as well but it's muted):
